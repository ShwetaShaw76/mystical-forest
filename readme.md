# Mystic Forest

I tried to build a nighttime forest-themed website and made it look like the player is a camping in a forest with a tent and bonfire and to add a twist to that I also added some of my favourite pokemon characters( Raboot and Dragapult ) that player can interact with and also the player can sit beside the bonfire to get an amazing camping experience with realistic sound effects.

# Controls

- Use WASD or movement keys for movement 
- You can use E or Q button for interactions with the pokemons (raboot and dragapult will interact on E button but only if you are close to them, Q button can be used when close to raboot to make it follow you)
- There is a Sleep button in the tent where you can sleep
- There is a sit button beside the bonfire where you can sit(movements are restricted while sitting)
